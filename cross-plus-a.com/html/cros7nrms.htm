<h3>Nurimisaki</h3>

<p><b>Nurimisaki</b> (from Japanese, literally <i>"paint a cape"</i>) is a logic puzzle invented by Nikoli. A rectangular or square grid contains circles in some cells; a circle may have a number inside or not. The task is to blacken some cells of a grid according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>White cells form a path exactly one cell wide.</li>
<li>Cells with circles are always white.</li>
<li>A cell with a circle must have exactly one white cell adjacent to its side.</li>
<li>A white cell without a circle must have at least two orthogonally adjacent white cells.</li>
<li>A number in a circle indicates how many white cells can be seen horizontally and vertically from that cell, including the cell itself.</li>
<li>All the white cells must be connected horizontally or vertically.</li>
<li>No <b>2&nbsp;x&nbsp;2</b> cell area within the grid can have the same color.</li>
</ul>
