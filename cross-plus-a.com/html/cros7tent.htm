<h3>Tents</h3>

<p><b>Tents</b> (<i>"Tents and Trees"</i>) is a logic puzzle invented by Léon Balmaekers (Netherlands). The task is a grid of squares, some of them contain trees. The goal is to place tents in some of the remaining squares, in such a way that the following conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are exactly as many tents as trees.</li>
<li>The tents and trees can be matched up in such a way that each tent is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally) to its own tree. However, a tent may be adjacent to other trees as well as its own.</li>
<li>No two tents are adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally.</li>
<li>The number of tents in each row, and in each column, matches the numbers given round the sides of the grid.</li>
</ul>
