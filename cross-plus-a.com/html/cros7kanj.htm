<h3>Kanjo</h3>

<p><b>Kanjo</b> (<i>"Kanjo-sen supesharu"</i>; from Japanese, literally <i>"special ring line"</i>) is a logic puzzle. A rectangular or square grid contains circles with numbers in some cells. The goal is to draw loops that properly passes through all cells. A loop may cross itself or other loops. All given line fregments must be used as a part of a loop. Cells with the same number belong to the same loop. Cells with different numbers belong to different loops. A loop must go trough at least one cell with a number (there are exactly as many loops as a grid contains different numbers). A cell with a number must not contain the intersection point where a loop crosses itself or other loop.</p>
