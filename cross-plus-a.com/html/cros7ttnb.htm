<h3>Tontonbeya</h3>

<p><b>Tontonbeya</b> (from Japanese, literally <i>"Gambler"</i>) is a logic puzzle published by Nikoli. A rectangular or square grid is divided into regions. The goal is to fill in each cell with figures: squares, circles, triangles. A region may contain any types of figures, but if they are of different types, the number of figures of each type should be the same. All figures of the same type in a region must be connected horizontally or vertically (they form a "block"). Each block of the same figures within one region must be adjacent to a block of the same figures in another region. There should not be a block that is adjacent to two or more blocks of the same figures in other regions.</p>
