<h3>Snake Pit</h3>

<p><b>Snake Pit</b> consists of a rectangular or square grid. The goal is to to divide the grid into regions ("snakes") according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>A snake is a one-cell-wide path at least two cells long. A snake cannot touch itself, not even diagonally.</li>
<li>A cell with a circle must be at one of the ends of a snake. A snake may contain one circled cell, two circled cells, or no circled cells at all.</li>
<li>A cell with a number must be part of a snake with a length of exactly that number of cells. A snake may contain any amount of numbered cells.</li>
<li>Two snakes of the same length must not be orthogonally adjacent.</li>
<li>A cell with a cross cannot be an end of a snake.</li>
</ul>
