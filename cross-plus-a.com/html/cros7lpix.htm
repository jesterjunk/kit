<h3>Link-a-Pix</h3>

<p><b>Link-a-Pix</b> (also known as <i>"Paint by pairs"</i>) consists of a grid, with numbers filling some squares; pairs of numbers must be located correctly and connected with a line filling a total of squares equal to that number. Squares containing '1' represent paths that are 1-square long. Paths may follow any horizontal or vertical direction. Paths are not allowed to cross other paths.</p>

<p>There is only one unique way to link all the squares in a properly-constructed puzzle. When completed, the squares that have lines are filled; the contrast with the blank squares reveals the picture.</p>
