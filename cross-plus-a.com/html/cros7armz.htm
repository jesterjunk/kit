<h3>Arrow Maze</h3>

<p><b>Arrow Maze</b> (<i>"Arrow Path"</i>) consists of a rectangular or square grid with arrows. The aim is to find a path through the grid by visiting every cell once. The path is starting from the cell with number 1. The path can jump from one cell to another in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction, but only in the direction of the arrow. Some numbers have already been given.</p>
