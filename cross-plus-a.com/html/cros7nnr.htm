<h3>Nanro</h3>

<p><b>Nanro</b> (<i>"Number Road"</i>) is a logic puzzle published by Nikoli. The task consists of a rectangular or square grid divided into regions. The goal is to fill in some cells with numbers. All numbers in a region must be the same. The given number in a region denotes how many cells in this region contain a number (all regions must have at least one number). When two numbers are orthogonally adjacent across a region boundary, the numbers must be different. Numbered cells must not cover an area of size <b><span class="nbt">2 x 2</span></b> or larger. All cells with numbers must be interconnected.</p>
