<h3>Hashiwokakero</h3>

<p><b>Hashiwokakero</b> (from Japanese "Hashi o kakero"; literally "build bridges"; also known as <i>"Hashi"</i>, <i>"Bridges"</i>, <i>"Chopsticks"</i> or <i>"Ai-Ki-Ai"</i>) is a type of logic puzzle. It is played on a rectangular grid with no standard size, although the grid itself is not usually drawn. Some cells start out with (usually encircled) numbers from 1 to 8 inclusive; these are the islands. The rest of the cells are empty.</p>

<p>The goal is to connect all of the islands into a single connected group by drawing a series of bridges between the islands. The bridges must follow certain criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>They must begin and end at distinct islands, travelling a straight line in between.</li>
<li>They must not cross any other bridges or islands.</li>
<li>They may only run orthogonally.</li>
<li>At most two bridges connect a pair of islands.</li>
<li>The number of bridges connected to each island must match the number on that island.</li>
</ul>
