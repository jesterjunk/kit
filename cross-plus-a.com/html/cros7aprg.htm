<h3>Akiperago</h3>

<p><b>Akiperago</b> (<i>"Archipelago"</i>) is a logic puzzle published by Nikoli. A rectangular or square grid contains black cells; some of them contain numbers. The goal is to blacken some cells of a grid according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>The black cells form "islands". No two islands may share an edge; islands may be connected through their corners.</li>
<li>If an island contains a numbered cell, this number represents the amount of black cells in the island. An island may contain few numbered cells (all numbers will be the same inside an island).</li>
<li>All islands form "archipelagos". An archipelago is a group of two or more islands, connected through their corners.</li>
<li>If an archipelago contains N islands, they will be from 1 to N cells (not necessarily in that order).</li>
</ul>
