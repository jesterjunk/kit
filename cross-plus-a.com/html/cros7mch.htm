<h3>Mochikoro</h3>

<p><b>Mochikoro</b> (<i>"Mochinuri"</i>) is a logic puzzle. It consists of a grid, with numbers in some cells. The aim is to blacken some cells according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>The black cells divide the grid in rectangular areas ("islands") of white cells.</span></li>
<li>No two islands may share an edge, but all of the islands must be connected to each other through their corners.</li>
<li>Each numbered cell must be a part of a white island. Some white areas may not include a cell with a number.</li>
<li>Each island must have the same number of white cells as the number it contains (including the numbered cell).</li>
<li>No <b>2&nbsp;x&nbsp;2</b> cell area within the grid can contain all black cells.</li>
</ul>
