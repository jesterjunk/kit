<h3>Mintonette</h3>

<p><b>Mintonette</b> (the original name of the game known as volleyball) is played on a grid of irregular shape with circles in some cells. The goal is to connect circles in pairs by drawing a line that goes horizontally and vertically through the centers of cells. Lines cannot touch or cross themselves or each other. If a circle contains a number, it represents the number of turns for the line between two circles. If two circles have no number, a line may make any number of turns between circles. All cells must be used by the lines, and each circle must be connected to another circle.</p>
