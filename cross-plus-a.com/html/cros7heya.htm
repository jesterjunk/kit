<h3>Heyablock</h3>

<p><b>Heyablock</b> (<i>"Heyawake-Block"</i>) is a logic puzzle invented by Atsumi Hirose (Japan). A rectangular or square grid is divided into regions. The aim is to blacken some cells of a grid according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>All black cells in a region must be connected.</li>
<li>A cell with a number indicates how many cells in the region must be blackened.</li>
<li>In regions without a number any amount of cells may be blackened (at least one).</li>
<li>When two cells are orthogonally adjacent across a region boundary, at least one cell must be white.</li>
<li>All white cells form one orthogonally connected area.</li>
<li>A line of connected white cells cannot go through two or more region borders.</li>
</ul>
