<h3>Triangles</h3>

<p>The program can solve and create puzzles with triangular cells.</p>

<p id="Hoshi"><b>Hoshi</b> consists of six large triangles; the numbers 1 through 9 must be placed into the triangular cells of each large triangle. Every line (of any length, even uncontinous) contains every digit not more than once.</p>

The puzzle consists of nine large triangles; the numbers 1 through 9 must be placed into the triangular cells of each large triangle. Also, the numbers 1 through 9 must be placed in the three legs of the inner shaded triangle and in the three legs of the outer shaded triangle.
