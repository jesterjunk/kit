<h3>Miti</h3>

<p><b>Miti</b> (from Japanese, literally <i>"road"</i>) is a logic puzzle created by Nishiyama Yukari (Japan). A rectangular or square grid contains dots at some intersections of the grid lines. The goal is to blacken some borders between cells. In each given grid dot exactly three black lines must meet. In all other grid dots at most two black lines may intersect. All cells of the grid form a single closed loop without dead ends, exactly one cell wide.</p>
