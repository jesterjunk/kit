<h3>Island</h3>

<p><b>Island</b> (also known as <i>"Tents Island"</i>, <i>"Airando"</i>) is a logic puzzle invented by Naoki Inaba (Japan). It consists of a grid, with numbers in some cells. The aim is to blacken some cells of a grid according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>The white cells form a single island. Each numbered cell must be a part of this island.</li>
<li>The numbers indicate how many unnumbered white cells can be reached from that cell by moving horizontally or vertically. Numbered cells block access.</li>
</ul>
