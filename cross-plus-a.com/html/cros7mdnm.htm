<h3>Meandering Numbers</h3>

<p><b>Meandering Numbers</b> (also known as <i>"Count Number"</i>, <i>"Worms"</i>) is played on a rectangular or square grid divided into regions. A grid may contain numbers in some cells. Each region must be filled with each of the digits from 1 to N, where N is the number of cells in the region. Cells with the same digits must not be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent. Consecutive numbers within the region are orthogonally adjacent. (For each region it must be possible to draw a path that starts at 1 and ends at N, going through each other cell exactly once and in numerically increasing order.)</p>
