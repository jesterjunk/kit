<h3>Chenburo</h3>

<p><b>Chenburo</b> (<i>"Chain Block"</i>) is a logic puzzle published by Nikoli. A grid contains numbers or question marks in some cells. The aim is to blacken some cells of a grid according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>The black cells form blocks. No blocks touch each other horizontally or vertically (only diagonally).</li>
<li>A number represents the amount of black cells in the block. Question marks can be used instead of clue numbers. Each question mark can represent any nonzero integer.</li>
<li>Each block contains exactly one number or a question mark.</li>
<li>All blocks form "chains". A chain is a group of two or more blocks, connected through their corners.</li>
<li>Two blocks belonging to the same chain may not have the same shape and size, counting rotations and reflections as the same.</li>
</ul>
