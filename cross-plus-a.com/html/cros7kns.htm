<h3>Knossos</h3>

<p><b>Knossos</b> is a logic puzzle ("Knossos" is a palace on Crete; this palace is connected with ancient legends, such as the myth of the Labyrinth with the Minotaur). It is played on a rectangular grid. Some of the cells in the grid are numbered. The goal is to divide the grid into regions (“rooms”) such that each region contains exactly one number. The number represents the border’s length of the region.</p>
