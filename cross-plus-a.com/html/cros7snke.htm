<h3>Snake</h3>

<p><b>Snake</b> (also known as <i>"Tunnel"</i>) is a kind of logic puzzles. It is played on a rectangular or square grid, where two cells are marked. The task is to draw a single line ("snake") between marked cells; this line never touches itself, not even diagonally. Numbers outside the grid show how many cells must be blackened in the corresponding row or column.</p>
