<h3>Easy as ABC</h3>

<p><b>Easy as ABC</b> (<i>"ABC End View"</i>, <i>"Last Man Standing"</i>) is a square grid, whose cells are to be filled by a range of letters (e.g. A through E), with each different letter occurring exactly once in each row and column, and the other cells remaining empty. The letters outside the grid show which letter will come across first from that direction.</p>

<p><b>Not as Easy as ABC</b> is a variation of <b>Easy as ABC</b> puzzle. The goal is to fill in the first letters of the alphabet on every row and every column exactly once. One cell in every row and every column remains empty. Letters and numbers on the outside indicate at what position you come across this letter when looking from that side (e.g. C<sub>2</sub> means the C is the second letter encountered when looking from that side).</p>
