<h3>Kuromasu</h3>

<p><b>Kuromasu</b> (from Japanese "kuromasu wa doko da", literally <i>"Where is black cells?"</i>; also known as <i>"Kurodoko"</i>) is played on a rectangular grid. Some of these cells have numbers in them. Each cell may be either black or white. The object is to determine what type each cell is.</p>

<p>The following rules determine which cells are which:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each number on the board represents the number of white cells that can be seen from that cell, including itself. A cell can be seen from another cell if they are in the same row or column, and there are no black cells between them in that row or column.</li>
<li>Numbered cells may not be black.</li>
<li>No two black cells may be horizontally or vertically adjacent.</li>
<li>All the white cells must be connected horizontally or vertically.</li>
</ul>
