<h3>Linesweeper</h3>

<p><b>Linesweeper</b> (<i>"Loop"</i>) is played on a rectangular grid. The object is to create a single continuous non-intersecting loop that connects the centers of the grid cells. The numbered cells can't be passed through; the number in the cell means how many of the 8 surrounding cells should contain some part of the solution path. (For example, "0" means that 8 surrounding cells can't be passed through at all).</p>
