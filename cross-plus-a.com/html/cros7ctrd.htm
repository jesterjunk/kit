<h3>Country Road</h3>

<p><b>Country Road</b> is a logic puzzle invented by Nikoli. The puzzle consists of a rectangular grid of any size divided into regions. The goal is to draw a single continuous non-intersecting loop that connects the centers of the grid cells. The loop must visit each region exactly once. The number in a region indicates how many cells of this region are visited by the loop. In regions without a number the loop may visit any number of cells. If the loop does not visit any two neigbouring cells, these cells must be in the same region.</p>
