<h3>Mid-Loop</h3>

<p><b>Mid-Loop</b> is a logic puzzle published by Nikoli. A rectangular or square grid contains dots; a dot can be situated in the center of a cell or on a border between neighbouring cells. The aim is to draw a single continuous non-intersecting loop that properly passes through all dots. Dots must be traveled straight through. Segments of a straight line going out of a dot must be equal.</p>
