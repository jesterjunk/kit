<h3>Sashikazune</h3>

<p><b>Sashikazune</b> is a logic puzzle published by Nikoli. A rectangular or square grid contains numbers in some cells. The aim is to divide the grid into L-shaped regions. The two "legs" of a region must be exactly one cell wide. Each region contains not more than three cells with numbers. The grid may contain regions without numbers. A number indicates the amount of cells up to a place where an "L" must bend (including the cell with the number). A cell with "1" always represents a cell in which an "L" must bend.</p>
