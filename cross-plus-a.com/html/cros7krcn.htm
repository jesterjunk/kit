<h3>Kuroclone</h3>

<p><b>Kuroclone</b> is a logic puzzle published by Nikoli. A rectangular or square grid is divided into regions. The aim is to blacken some cells of a grid. Each region must contain two areas of black cells: this pair of areas must be of the same shape and size (the areas may be rotated or mirrored). Cells with numbers are always white. The arrow points to an adjacent cell that belongs to a black area. The number indicates the size of this area. When two cells are orthogonally adjacent across a region boundary, at least one cell must be white.</p>
