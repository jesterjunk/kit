<h3>Masyu</h3>

<p><b>Masyu</b> (also known as <i>"Shiroshinju Kuroshinju"</i>, <i>"White pearls and black pearls"</i>) is a type of logic puzzle. It is played on a rectangular grid of squares, some of which contain circles; each circle is either "white" (empty) or "black" (filled). The goal is to draw a single continuous non-intersecting loop that properly passes through all circled cells. The loop must "enter" each cell it passes through from the center of one of its four sides and "exit" from a different side; all turns are therefore 90 degrees.</p>

<p>The two varieties of circle have differing requirements for how the loop must pass through them:</p>

<ul>
<li>White circles must be traveled straight through, but the loop must turn in the previous and/or next cell in its path.</li>
<li>Black circles must be turned upon, but the loop must travel straight through the next and previous cells in its path.</li>
</ul>
