<h3>Str8ts</h3>

<p><b>Str8ts</b> (also known as <i>"Straights"</i>) is a logic puzzle, invented by Jeff Widderich (Canada). It is a grid, partially divided by black cells into compartments. Each compartment, vertically or horizontally, must contain a straight - a set of consecutive numbers, but in any order (for example: 2-1-3-4). The aim is to fill all white cells with the numbers from 1 to N (where N is the size of the grid). No single number can repeat in any row or column. Clues in black cells remove that number as an option in that row and column, and are not part of any straight.</p>
