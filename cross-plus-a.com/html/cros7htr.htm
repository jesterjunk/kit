<h3>Hitori</h3>

<p><b>Hitori</b> (from Japanese "Hitori ni shite kure"; literally "let me alone") is a type of logic puzzles.</p>

<p>Hitori is played on a grid of squares. At the beginning, each cell contains a number. The goal is to paint out some cells so that there are no duplicate numbers in any row or column, similar to the solved state of a Sudoku puzzle (except with black squares added to the grid).</p>

<p>Orthogonal connections are important as well; painted-out (black) cells cannot be connected orthogonally, and the other cells must be connected orthogonally in a single group (i.e. no two black squares can be adjacent to each other, and all un-painted squares must be connected, horizontally or vertically, to create a single shape).</p>
