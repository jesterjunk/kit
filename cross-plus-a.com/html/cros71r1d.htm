<h3>Wanrumuwandoa</h3>

<p><b>Wanrumuwandoa</b> (<i>"One Room One Door"</i>) is a logic puzzle published by Nikoli. A rectangular or square grid is divided into regions ("rooms"). A region may contain a cell with a number. The goal is to blacken some cells of a grid according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>A cell with a number indicates how many cells in the region must be blackened. In regions without a number any amount of cells may be blackened.</li>
<li>Blackened cells should not share an edge.</li>
<li>All the white cells must be connected inside a region (it's possible for a region to have no white cells).</li>
<li>If two white cells are orthogonally adjacent across a region boundary, they form a "door". There can be no more than one door between any two regions.</li>
<li>All the white cells must form an orthogonally continuous area.</li>
</ul>
