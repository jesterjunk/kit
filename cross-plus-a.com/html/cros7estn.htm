<h3>Every Second Turn</h3>

<p><b>Every Second Turn</b> (also known as <i>"Alternate Corners"</i>, <i>"Every Second Breakpoint"</i>) is a rectangular or square grid with circles in some cells. The aim is to draw a single continuous non-intersecting loop that visits every cell exactly ones. It makes a 90 degrees turn at every cell with a circle. There is exactly one turn between two consecutive circles that the loop visits.</p>
