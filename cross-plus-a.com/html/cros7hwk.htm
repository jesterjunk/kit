<h3>Heyawake</h3>

<p><b>Heyawake</b> (from Japanese, <i>"divided rooms"</i>) is played on a rectangular grid. The grid is divided into rectangular "rooms". Some rooms may contain a single number. These rooms must have the designated number of cells painted black. Other rooms may have zero or more cells painted black.</p>

<ul>
<li>Black cells must not be orthogonally connected.</li>
<li>All white cells must be interconnected.</li>
<li>A line of connected white cells must not connect more than two rooms together.</li>
</ul>
