<h3>Stostone</h3>

<p><b>Stostone</b> (<i>"Stone on Stone"</i>) is a logic puzzle invented by Nikoli. A rectangular or square grid is divided into regions. The goal is to blacken some cells of a grid ("stones") according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>All black cells in a region must be connected horizontally or vertically.</li>
<li>A cell with a number indicates how many cells in the region must be blackened.</li>
<li>In regions without a number any amount of cells may be blackened (at least one).</li>
<li>When two cells are orthogonally adjacent across a region boundary, at least one cell must be white.</li>
<li>If all stones "fall down", they must cover exactly the bottom half of the grid.</li>
</ul>
