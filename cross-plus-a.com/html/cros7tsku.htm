<h3>Tasukuea</h3>

<p><b>Tasukuea</b> (from Japanese, literally <i>"find squares"</i>) is a type of logic puzzles. It is played on a rectangular or square grid with numbers or question signs in some cells. The goal is to blacken some cells of a grid according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cells with numbers or question signs can not be blacken.</li>
<li>Black cells form square areas that must not be orthogonally adjacent.</li>
<li>A number in a circle indicates the total number of black cells in areas orthogonally neighboring the numbered cell.</li>
<li>A cell with a question sign must have at least one adjacent black cell.</li>
<li>All the white cells must be connected horizontally or vertically.</li>
</ul>
