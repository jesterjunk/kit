<h3>Sudoku 9 x 9</h3>

<p><b>Sudoku</b> (also known as <i>"Number Place"</i>) is a placement puzzle. The puzzle is most frequently a <b><span class="nbt">9 x 9</span></b> grid made up of <b><span class="nbt">3 x 3</span></b> subgrids (called "regions"). Some cells already contain numbers, known as "givens". The goal is to fill in the empty cells, one number in each, so that each column, row, and region contains the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once. Each number in the solution therefore occurs only once in each of three "directions", hence the "single numbers" implied by the puzzle's name.</p>

<p id="X">In some sudokus main diagonals also contain the digits 1 through 9. This variant is called <b>Sudoku X</b> (<i>"Diagonal Sudoku"</i> or <i>"Kokonotsu"</i>). Use the check box <b>Diagonals</b> for such sudokus.</p>

<p id="Argyle"><b>Argyle Sudoku</b> contains additional diagonals; every marked diagonal line contains each digit not more than once. The argyle pattern is derived from the tartan of Clan Campbell, in eastern Scotland.</p>

<p id="DG"><b>Sudoku-DG</b> (also known as <i>"Offset Sudoku"</i>) contains 9 disjoint groups in the puzzle, one for each relative box position. Each group has a distinct color. The group of 9 cells with the same color must also contain digits 1 through 9.</p>

<p id="Anti-Knight">In <b>Anti-Knight Sudoku</b> all cells at a chess knight move (at a distance of 2 by 1) must hold different numbers.</p>

<p id="Anti-King">In <b>Anti-King Sudoku</b> (<i>"Touchless Sudoku"</i>) equal digits can be neither orthogonally nor diagonally adjacent.</p>
