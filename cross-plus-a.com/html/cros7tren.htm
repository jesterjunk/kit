<h3>Tren</h3>

<p><b>Tren</b> is a logic puzzle invented by Shinichi Aoki (Japan). The Japanese name of this puzzle means "parking" (each block is a car, and a grid is a car park). The puzzle contains a grid with numbers in some cells. The goal is to locate some blocks in the grid, having the size either <b>1&nbsp;x&nbsp;2</b> or <b>1&nbsp;x&nbsp;3</b>. Each number in the grid should be part of a block, indicating the amount of the possible movements of the block. Blocks can only move in the direction of their short edge.</p>
